For the extra credit, I designed a least
frequently used (LFU) replacement policy.
To run the extra credit, change the 0 to a 1
at the bottom of the main method where the
extra credit function is called.
This policy printed results that were
more efficient than both LRU replacement
and the next-line prefetcher when run on
the provided traces (1-3). I used vectors to
track the frequency of tags. For replacement,
the function chooses the tag with the lowest
frequency, hence the name of the policy.
